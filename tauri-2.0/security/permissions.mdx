Permissions are descriptions of explicit privileges of commands.

```toml
[[permission]]
identifier = "my-identifier"
description = "This describes the impact and more."
commands.allow = [
    "read_file"
]

[[scope.allow]]
my-scope = "$HOME/*"

[[scope.deny]]
my-scope = "$HOME/secret"
```

It can enable commands to be accessible in the frontend of a Tauri application.
It can map scopes to commands and defines which commands are enabled.
Permissions can enable or deny certain commands, define scopes or combine both.

Permissions can be grouped as a set under a new identifier.
This is called a permission set. This allows you to combine scope related permissions
with command related permissions. It also allows to group or bundle operating
specific permissions into more usable sets.

As a plugin developer you can ship multiple, pre-defined, well named permissions
for all of your exposed commands.

As an application developer you can extend existing plugin permissions or
define them for your own commands.
They can be grouped or extended in a set to be re-used or to simplify the main
configuration files later.

## Permission Identifier

The permissions identifier is used to ensure that permissions can be re-used and have unique names.

:::tip

With **name** we refer to the plugin crate name without the `tauri-plugin-` prefix.
This is meant as namespacing to reduce likelihood of naming conflicts.
When referencing permissions of the application itself it is not necessary.

:::

- `<name>:default` Indicates the permission is the default for a plugin or application
- `<name>:<command-name>` Indicates the permission is for an individual command

The plugin prefix `tauri-plugin-` will be automatically prepended to the identifier of plugins
at compile time and is not required to be manually specified.

Identifiers are limited to ASCII lower case alphabetic characters `[a-z]` and the maximum length
of the identifier is currently limited to `116` due to the following constants:

```rust
const IDENTIFIER_SEPARATOR: u8 = b':';
const PLUGIN_PREFIX: &str = "tauri-plugin-";

// https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-name-field
const MAX_LEN_PREFIX: usize = 64 - PLUGIN_PREFIX.len();
const MAX_LEN_BASE: usize = 64;
const MAX_LEN_IDENTIFIER: usize = MAX_LEN_PREFIX + 1 + MAX_LEN_BASE;
```

## Configuration Files

Simplified example of an example Tauri **plugin** directory structure:

```sh
tauri-plugin
├── README.md
├── src
│  └── lib.rs
├── build.rs
├── Cargo.toml
├── permissions
│  └── <identifier>.json/toml
│  └── default.json/toml
```

The default permission is handled in a special way,
as it is automatically added to the application
configuration, as long as the Tauri CLI is used to
add plugins to a Tauri application.

For **application** developers the structure is similar:

```sh
tauri-app
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── src
├── src-tauri
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── permissions
│      └── <identifier>.toml
|   ├── capabilities
│      └── <identifier>.json/.toml
│   ├── src
│   ├── tauri.conf.json
```

:::note

As an application developer the capability files can be written in `json`/`json5` or `toml`,
whereas permissions only can be defined in `toml`.

## Examples

Example permissions from the `File System` plugin.

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/autogenerated/base-directories/home.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "scope-home"
description = """This scope permits access to all files and
list content of top level directories in the `$HOME`folder."""

[[scope.allow]]
path = "$HOME/*"
```

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/read-files.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "read-files"
description = """This enables all file read related
commands without any pre-configured accessible paths."""
commands.allow = [
    "read_file",
    "read",
    "open",
    "read_text_file",
    "read_text_file_lines",
    "read_text_file_lines_next"
]
```

```toml title="plugins/fs/permissions/autogenerated/commands/mkdir.toml"
[[permission]]
identifier = "allow-mkdir"
description = "This enables the mkdir command."
commands.allow = [
    "mkdir"
]
```

Example implementation extending above plugin permissions in your app:

```toml title="my-app/src-tauri/permissions/home-read-extends.toml"
[[set]]
identifier = "allow-home-read-extended"
description = """ This allows non-recursive read access to files and to create directories
in the `$HOME` folder.
"""
permissions = [
    "fs:read-files",
    "fs:scope-home",
    "fs:allow-mkdir"
]
```
