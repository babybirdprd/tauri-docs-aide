This section describes topics we started or would like to tackle
in the future to make Tauri apps even more secure.
If you feel interested in these topics or have pre-existing
knowledge we are always happy to welcome new contributors
and advice via GitHub or other community platforms like Discord.

### Binary Analysis

To allow pentesters, auditors and automated security checks
do to their job properly it is very valuable to provide insight even from
compiled binaries. Not all companies are open source or provide source code
for audits, red-teams and other security testing.

Another often overlooked point is that providing inbuilt metadata empowers
users of your application to audit their systems for known vulnerabilities
at scale without dedicating their lifetime and efforts into it.

If your threatmodel depends on security by obscurity this section will be
providing some tools and points which hopefully will make you reconsider.

For Rust there is `cargo-auditable` to create [SBOMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain)
and provide exact crate versions and dependencies of a binary without breaking reproducible builds.

For the frontend stack we are not aware of similar solutions, so extracting
the frontend assets from the binary should be a straightforward process.
Afterwards it should be possible to use tooling like `npm audit` or similar.
There are already [blog posts](https://infosecwriteups.com/reverse-engineering-a-native-desktop-application-tauri-app-5a2d92772da5)
about the process but no simple tooling is available.

We are planning to provide such tooling or make it easier to extract assets,
when compiling a Tauri app with certain features.

To use pentesting tools like [Burpsuite](https://portswigger.net/burp),
[Zap](https://www.zaproxy.org/) or [Caido](https://caido.io/) it is necessary
to intercept traffic from the webview and pass it through the testing proxy.
Currently Tauri has no inbuilt method to do so but there is ongoing work to
ease this process.

All of these tools allow to properly test and inspect Tauri applications
without source code access and should be considered when building a Tauri application.

We are planning to further support and implement related features in the future.

### WebView Hardening

In Tauri's current threat model and boundaries we are not able to add more
security constraints to the WebView itself and since it is the biggest part of
our stack which is written in an memory unsafe language, we are planning to research and
consider ways to further sandbox and isolate the webview processes.

Inbuilt and external sandboxing methods will be evaluated to reduce attack impact
and to enforce the IPC bridge for system access.
We believe that this part of our stack is the weak link but current generation WebViews
are improving in their hardening and exploit resilience.

### Fuzzing

To allow more efficient and simplify the process of fuzzing Tauri applications
we aim to further implement our mock runtimes and other tooling to make it easier
to configure and build for individual Tauri applications.

Tauri is supporting a multitude of Operating Systems and CPU architectures, usually
apps have only few or no possible memory unsafe code.
No pre-existing fuzzing tooling and libraries support these uncommon fuzzing use case,
so we need to implement it and support existing libraries like [libAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL)
to build Tauri fuzzing frameworks.

The goal is to make fuzzing accessible and efficient for Tauri application developers.
