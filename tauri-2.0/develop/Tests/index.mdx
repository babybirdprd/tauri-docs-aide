Tauri offers support for both unit and integration testing utilizing a mock runtime. Under the mock runtime, native
webview libraries are not executed. [See more about the mock runtime here].

Tauri also provides support for end-to-end testing support utilizing the WebDriver protocol. Both desktop and mobile
work with it, except for macOS which does not provide a desktop WebDriver client. [See more about WebDriver support here].

We offer [tauri-action] to help run GitHub actions, but any sort of CI/CD runner can be used with Tauri as long as each
platform has the required libraries installed to compile against.
