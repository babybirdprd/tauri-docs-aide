In this guide we are going to package a Node.js application to a self contained binary
to be used as a sidecar in a Tauri application without requiring the end user to have a Node.js installation.
This example tutorial is applicable for desktop operating systems only.

We recommend reading the general [sidecar guide] first for a deeper understanding of how Tauri sidecars work.

In this example we will create a Node.js application that reads input from the command line [process.argv]
and writes output to stdout using [console.log]. <br/>
You can leverage alternative inter-process communication systems such as a localhost server, stdin/stdout or local sockets.
Note that each has their own advantages, drawbacks and security concerns.

## Prerequisites

An existing Tauri application set up with the shell plugin, that compiles and runs for you locally.

:::tip[Create a lab app]

If you are not an advanced user it's **highly recommended** that you use the options and frameworks provided here. It's just a lab, you can delete the project when you're done.

<CTA />

- Project name: `node-sidecar-lab`
- Choose which language to use for your frontend: `Typescript / Javascript`
- Choose your package manager: `pnpm`
- Choose your UI template: `Vanilla`
- Choose your UI flavor: `Typescript`
- Would you like to setup the project for mobile as well? `yes`

:::note
Please follow the [shell plugin guide](/plugin/shell/) first to set up and initialize the plugin correctly.
Without the plugin being initialized and configured the example won't work.

## Guide

<Steps>

1.  ##### Initialize Sidecar Project

    Let's create a new Node.js project to contain our sidecar implementation.
    Create a new directory **in your Tauri application root folder** (in this example we will call it `sidecar-app`)
    and run the `init` command of your preferred Node.js package manager inside the directory:

    <CommandTabs npm="npm init" yarn="yarn init" pnpm="pnpm init" />

    We will compile our Node.js application to a self container binary using [pkg].
    Let's install it as a development dependency:

    <CommandTabs
      npm="npm add @yao-pkg/pkg --save-dev"
      yarn="yarn add @yao-pkg/pkg --dev"
      pnpm="pnpm add @yao-pkg/pkg --save-dev"
    />

1.  ##### Write Sidecar Logic

    Now we can start writing JavaScript code that will be executed by our Tauri application.

    In this example we will process a command from the command line argmuents and write output to stdout,
    which means our process will be short lived and only handle a single command at a time.
    If your application must be long lived, consider using alternative inter-process communication systems.

    Let's create a `index.js` file in our `sidecar-app` directory and write a basic Node.js app:

    ```js title=sidecar-app/index.js
    const command = process.argv[2];

    switch (command) {
      case 'ping':
        const message = process.argv[3];
        console.log(`pong, ${message}`);
        break;
      default:
        console.error(`unknown command ${command}`);
        process.exit(1);
    }
    ```

1.  ##### Package the Sidecar

    To package our Node.js application to a self contained binary, we can run the following `pkg` command:

    <CommandTabs
      npm="npm run pkg -- --output app"
      yarn="yarn pkg --output app"
      pnpm="pnpm pkg --output app"
    />

    This will create the `sidecar-app/app` binary on Linux and macOS, and a `sidecar-app/app.exe` executable on Windows.
    To rename this file to the expected Tauri sidecar filename, we can use the following Node.js script:

    ```js
    import { execSync } from 'child_process';
    import fs from 'fs';

    const ext = process.platform === 'win32' ? '.exe' : '';

    const rustInfo = execSync('rustc -vV');
    const targetTriple = /host: (\S+)/g.exec(rustInfo)[1];
    if (!targetTriple) {
      console.error('Failed to determine platform target triple');
    }
    fs.renameSync(
      `app${ext}`,
      `../src-tauri/binaries/app-${targetTriple}${ext}`
    );
    ```

1.  ##### Configure the Sidecar in the Tauri Application

    Now that we have our Node.js application ready, we can connect it to our Tauri application
    by configuring the [`bundle > externalBin`] array:

    ```json title="src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"
    {
      "bundle": {
        "externalBin": ["binaries/app"]
      }
    }
    ```

    The Tauri CLI will handle the bundling of the sidecar binary as long as it exists as `src-tauri/binaries/app-<target-triple>`.

1.  ##### Execute the Sidecar

    We can run the sidecar binary either from Rust code or directly from JavaScript.

    <Tabs syncKey="lang">

      <TabItem label="JavaScript">

        Let's execute the `ping` command in the Node.js sidecar directly:

        ```javascript
        import { Command } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-shell';

        const message = 'Tauri';

        const command = Command.sidecar('binaries/app', ['ping', message]);
        const output = await command.execute();
        const response = output.stdout;
        ```

      </TabItem>

      <TabItem label="Rust">

        Let's pipe a `ping` Tauri command to the Node.js sidecar:

        ```rust
        #[tauri::command]
        async fn ping(app: tauri::AppHandle, message: String) -> String {
          let sidecar_command = app
            .shell()
            .sidecar("app")
            .unwrap()
            .arg("ping")
            .arg(message);
          let output = sidecar_command.output().unwrap();
          let response = String::from_utf8(output.stdout).unwrap();
          response
        }
        ```

      </TabItem>

    </Tabs>
