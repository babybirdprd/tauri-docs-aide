# System Patterns

## Core Architecture Patterns
1. Multi-Process Architecture
   - Main process (Rust) with WebView isolation
   - IPC through command/event system
   - Sidecar processes for heavy tasks
   - Plugin system for extensibility

2. Security Model
   - CSP-based content security
   - Permission-based access control
   - Resource isolation patterns
   - Runtime authority checks

3. State Management
   - Thread-safe global state
   - Event-based updates
   - Cached resource access
   - Type-safe state sharing

## Implementation Patterns
1. Command System
   - Type-safe command handlers
   - Async/await patterns
   - Error propagation
   - State injection

2. Event System
   - Global event broadcasting
   - Window-specific events
   - Channel-based streaming
   - Event filtering

3. Resource Management
   - Cached resource loading
   - Path validation
   - Permission checks
   - Memory optimization

## Integration Patterns
1. Plugin Architecture
   - Core plugin initialization
   - Custom plugin development
   - Permission management
   - Frontend bindings

2. Frontend Communication
   - IPC message patterns
   - Event handling
   - Binary data transfer
   - Error handling

3. Platform Integration
   - Native API access
   - OS-specific features
   - Window management
   - System tray

## Development Patterns
1. Error Handling
   - Type-safe errors
   - Error propagation
   - User-friendly messages
   - Debug information

2. Testing
   - Unit test patterns
   - Integration testing
   - E2E with WebDriver
   - Mock systems

3. Security
   - Input validation
   - Resource protection
   - Permission checks
   - Secure defaults
